# Chess Timer ARM Project (bare-metal)

## Overview

This project involves the development of a comprehensive system for the STM32 "blue pill" ARM Cortex-M3 microcontroller, starting from ground zero. All aspects, including hardware initialization, peripheral configuration, and application logic, are crafted directly without reliance on pre-existing software frameworks or libraries.



### Drivers Implemented


- **GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output)**: Used for interfacing with external components such as buttons and switches.
- **LCD 2x16 Display**: Provides a visual interface for users to interact with the timer.
- **External Interrupt**: Enables interrupt-driven handling of user input for actions like starting, pausing, and resetting the timer.
- **System Timer (Systick)**: Provides a system-wide timer for precise timing operations.

### Application Layer

The `main.c` file serves as the application layer, orchestrating the interaction between various drivers and functionalities to implement the desired chess timer behavior.



### Functionality
## 1. Interchanging Between Players
## 2. Pause Button
## 3. Reset Button
